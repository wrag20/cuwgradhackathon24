** This Hackathon is **required** for CSC548 face-to-face class. However, anyone is welcome to participate <br>
** Each students will have to attempt to create an App of their own (No teams in this Hackathon)<br>
** **All participants will be rewarded**

## Challenge Overview

AI has rapidly become a key technology in boosting productivity. Its ability to learn and adapt has made it incredibly valuable. As Computer Science students, you have the opportunity to explore how AI can benefit society. Your task is to create a web app _prototype_ that showcases the potential of AI in enhancing efficiency and problem-solving.

An example application to this might be an app that translates and summarizes documents written in any foreign language. The output could be a sentiment analyzer, recommendation engine or anything of your choosing. **This is just an example. We recommend you come up with your own example**

In addition to references below, you will be given OpenAI API access. **More specification on that below**

## API Access

### General Info:

Each student will get their own key to access the OpenAI API. The key will be valid for the duration of the two days of the Hackathon with **limitations** mentioned below.

### Usage:

You can call the API through this URL "http://x.x.x.x:8099/generate", where the IP is going to be provided to you on the day of the Hackathon. Examples in Python and Javascript have been included to help you.

### Limitations:

1. Each student will have up to 10000 total API requests (Asking a question to the GPT Model would be 1 request)
2. Each request output has a maxmimum token count of 2048 Tokens (1 token ≈ 4 English Chars // 100 tokens ≈ 75 words)
3. Each student will be able to call the APIs during the Hackathons _ONLY_ and we are working on giving you access in between the two Hackathon days
